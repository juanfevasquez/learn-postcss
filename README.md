# Learn PostCSS
Learn PostCSS reading the articles in this repository

The tools used for the exercises include:
- Node: obviously
- Gulp: as our task manager
- Browser-sync.
- gulp-postcss: we will run postcss using the gulp plugin because I think using it through Gulp is easier.
- gulp-sass: This is important.  I'm not using precss because I think sass is pretty awesome and doesn't need to be replaced.  I don't want to use postcss as a css pre-processor.

Reading the article you will learn about the postcss plugins that I will use, but if you want to know in advance, then this is the list I will include in this repo:
- cssnext
- autoprefixer
- cssnano
- stylelint
- postcss assets
- postcss sprites
- lost grid
